# Mini-Project
Library Management System Java Project built using eclipse IDE. This project aims to provide a library system where users can easily search for books by name, author, genre. Users can borrow a book or return it to the library. The system can identify if the users have returned the books or not by showing information about the status of the book such as borrowing date, available, not available.
